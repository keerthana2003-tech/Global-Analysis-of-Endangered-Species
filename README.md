# Global-Analysis-of-Endangered-Species
# Endangered Species Dashboard â€“ Power BI Project

This project is created using **Microsoft Power BI** to analyze and visualize global endangered species data. Power BI is a business analytics tool that enables the creation of interactive reports and dashboards by combining data from multiple sources. The purpose of this project is to provide real-time insights into biodiversity conservation, allowing users to identify patterns, trends, and areas of concern in species preservation. Dashboards are used to simplify complex datasets into clear visual formats, making it easier for researchers, policymakers, and conservationists to make informed decisions.

## Overview Dashboard (Sheet 1)

The Overview Dashboard presents a global summary of endangered species, showing:
- **Bar Chart**: Species count by IUCN categories.
- **Line Chart**: Population trends over time.
- **Clustered Bar Chart**: Primary threats such as habitat loss, climate change, and human-wildlife conflict.
- **KPI Cards**: Total species count, critically endangered species, and biodiversity hotspots.

**Filters** allow detailed analysis of specific species categories.  
**Insights** highlight which categories face the highest risk, track changes in species numbers, and identify regions under maximum biodiversity threat.

## Geographic Dashboard (Sheet 2)

The Geographic Dashboard displays endangered species distribution by country and continent, featuring:
- **Map Visualization**: Geographic concentration of endangered species.
- **Pie Chart**: Proportional distribution by continent.
- **Data Table**: Top 10 countries with the highest number of endangered species.

**Filters** enable refined analysis by continent, primary threats, and Red List category.  
This helps conservation organizations, governments, and NGOs to focus on priority areas and allocate resources effectively.

## Key Insights

- Most endangered species fall under **Critically Endangered** and **Endangered** categories.
- Countries with the highest numbers include **Brazil**, **Indonesia**, and regions in **Europe**.
- Both marine and terrestrial species show declining population trends.
- **Africa** and **Asia** have the most critically endangered species.

These findings emphasize the urgent need for targeted conservation efforts and collaborative global action.
